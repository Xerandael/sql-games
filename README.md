# SQL Games

I like SQL a lot.  I'm seeking to challenge my skills by building games in SQL.  Through it all, I'm developing new patterns.  In this readme, I'll keep a list of the projects and an index of pattern examples.

## Projects
### Time Tactics
[https://github.com/Xerandael/sql-games/blob/master/chess.sql](Time Tactics) is a replication of [an interesting game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1349230/5D_Chess_With_Multiverse_Time_Travel/).  I aim to replicate the mechanics but no UI work is in scope.

## Index of interesting SQL patterns used in projects
### [Lazy infinite sequences in recursive views](https://github.com/Xerandael/sql-games/blob/4e9a34a918a6a629c2b8dae552215dc1653ec109/chess.sql#L3)

### [Concise, lazy, abstract definition of all possible lines in 4D, indexed on number of dimensions moved through](https://github.com/Xerandael/sql-games/blob/4e9a34a918a6a629c2b8dae552215dc1653ec109/chess.sql#L30-L68)
