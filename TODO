a timeline is created when more than one move ends on the same board.  the split happens with the move where:
  ((to_turn < from_turn) && (from_timeline = to_timeline))
  ||
  ((to_timeline != from_timeline)) -- TODO: incomplete logic?
OR equivalently, the non-split is the move where the board moved from is the board moved to.  well that's incomplete also...

check not all from=to
check ((from_turn % 2) = (to_turn % 2))
current_player = ((from_turn % 2) * 2) - 1
check (prev_timeline is not null || (from_timeline = 0))
check (both_fromto_timeline )
check player moving own piece?
check in bounds? FK to board definition

indexes
  ptl, ptn, px, py (unique?) FK
  ttl,ttn,tx,ty


knight movement definitions
pawn movement definitions

big piece switch statement with movement mechanic defintions


special consideration for turns.  multicolumn FK.  can move on each board.  moving between boards is a move on each.
uniqueness of movements from or to a board in time/timeline space.
partial index could be used to allow moving from and to the same board?


forking logic
get out a pen and paper and work this out
grouping and window functions????


CQRS.  players put in events and get back state.
