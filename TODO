a timeline is created when more than one move ends on the same board

`available_moves` view
`rendered_states` view

`moves` constraints:
check not all from=to
check ((from_turn % 2) = (to_turn % 2))
current_player = ((from_turn % 2) * 2) - 1
check (prev_timeline is not null || (from_timeline = 0))
check (both_from_and_to_timeline are within the set of available timeliens)
check player moving own piece?
check in bounds? FK to board definition

indexes
  ptl, ptn, px, py (unique?) FK
  ttl,ttn,tx,ty


knight movement definitions
pawn movement definitions

big piece switch statement with movement mechanic defintions


special consideration for turns.  multicolumn FK.  can move on each board.  moving between boards is a move on each.
uniqueness of movements from or to a board in time/timeline space.
partial index could be used to allow moving from and to the same board?


forking logic
get out a pen and paper and work this out
grouping and window functions????


CQRS.  players put in events and get back state.
